### Fully **customizable** Champ Select tool

CSW is the only app allowing the user to input their champ select knowledge.

Tired to see websites / apps giving champions a non-representative winrate?

From a dataset related to the latest LoL patch, **use your own knowledge to adjust which champion is op** and in which situation (Input what you think about this new champion K'sante for example !)

**Currently supported functionalities (v1.1.0) :**

-   Output a customizable winrate
-   Many champion suggestions
-   Successful Dodge Notification

**Incoming functionalities in January :**

-   Huge improvement to the customization (you will be able to input matchups for example)

A discord will be set up in early January.
